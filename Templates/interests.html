            <h2 class="fw-normal">Technology</h2>
            <p>Since my childhood, I was interested alot in Technologies. I was always dreamt of building a Robot.
                Soon after completing my 12th Standard, I decided to learn a Programming Language, and after a few 
                months, I completed learning Python Programming language and built many projects. The movie that inspired
                me more towards Technology is Ironman. After watching that movie, I understood one thing and that is,
                 A man with some great technological skills is just equal to a superhero.
                 When I was in schooling, in my English text book, there is a unit named "Satya Nadella", which is 
                 completely related to Satya Nadella's( CEO of Microsoft) Biography. In that unit, I have read a quotation 
                of Nadella, that is " If you stop learning new things, then you stop doing great things". This quotation has
            influenced me alot. From that point of life, I never stopped learning new things. So, these are some major reasons that
        make me love Technology.                </p>

            <h2 class="fw-normal">Content Creation</h2>
            <p> I love making Content Creation. So, because of this reason I created a 
                Youtube Channel named "Sohail Says". In this channel, I share my knowledge
                related to Technology with people. I discuss about various new emerging Technologies
                with people in the form of Youtube Videos. Apart From this, I make Vlogs, when I visits to 
                new and historic places and upload them on my Youtube channel. Content Creation is one of
                the major skills in 2022, it is growing day by day. Everyone should start creating Content
                on various platforms like Youtube, LinkedIn, Twitter etc...

            <h2 class="fw-normal">Capturing Pictures</h2>
            <p>Photography is one of my Hobby. I love taking photos of nature, animals and 
                beautiful monuments. Photography is an art of Creativity. Taking Pictures of 
                nature exactly as I wanted, and editing them and Saving them as a collection is 
                one thing that I love most. These photographs exists as a long lasting memories 
                in life. Soon, In this blog I am going to create a Page named "Photographs" and 
                I am going to add the pictures that I stored in My collection on that Page.
